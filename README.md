# Simple Pandas Examples

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks with simple pandas examples for beginners:

1. **create_df_from_dict.ipynb**  
   Shows how to create a pandas DataFrame from a dictionary of lists.

2. **basic_operations.ipynb**  
   Demonstrates basic DataFrame operations such as adding a new column and generating summary statistics.

## How to Use
- Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Run the cells to see the output.
- This is the last line so far. We will practice github in more details and will get comfortable with it soon.
